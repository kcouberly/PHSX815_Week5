# PHSX815_Week 5

Code Adapted from https://github.com/crogan/PHSX815_Week5

## Instructions for Using the Code

## SineRandom.py

Use -h to display possible inputs

Will run with default 100 samples, -NSample to change

Samples over the function Sin(pi*x) over the interval [0,1] using a flat proposal function

Produces plot shown in SineRandom.png 

## SphericalSampling.py

Change number of samples with -NSample (default 10000)

Samples 3-D over 1/8 section of a sphere radius 1 volume

With large number of samples, should give acceptance rate ~4/3*pi
